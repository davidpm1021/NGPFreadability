At the dawn of a new school year, the momentum for guaranteed financial education grows! Whether you're a veteran NGPF community member or brand new, we're honored to join you on the journey toward financial empowerment for all students. Today, we'd like to introduce you - or perhaps reintroduce you - to NGPF's Mission 2030.
By the year 2030, NGPF aims to guarantee that every U.S. high school student takes a standalone personal finance course before graduation. Why? managing money effectively is a skill that will serve students throughout their lives. The wonderful thing is... this incredible community is on track to achieve this ambitious goal.
You might be wondering why we use the word “guarantee” instead of “require.” Functionally, they mean the same thing, but there is an important distinction.
The word “requirement” carries an ominous weight in education. It suggests something obligatory added to an already full plate of responsibilities for both students and teachers. The term can sometimes (understandably) evoke resistance, particularly when policymakers, administrators, and educators feel like their autonomy is being encroached upon.
“Guaranteed” shifts the conversation in a more productive direction with stakeholders. When we say every student will be guaranteed a personal finance course, we emphasize equal access to a critical life skill. We’re not just adding another box to check; we’re making a promise to students, families, and communities that financial education will be delivered meaningfully and comprehensively. Let's ensure that all students, regardless of their zipcode, build financial literacy skills to thrive in their lives.
Some states have implemented policies where personal finance is embedded within other subjects, such as economics or math. While this approach might meet a technical requirement, it often falls short of providing students with comprehensive financial education. Research shows that in states with embedded requirements, only 39% of students actually receive personal finance instruction. That’s not a guarantee-that’s a gap.
A standalone course, on the other hand, dedicates time and resources specifically to personal finance, allowing students to explore topics like budgeting, investing, credit, and career planning in depth. This focused approach not only equips students with essential knowledge but also fosters confidence and empowers them to make informed decisions as they step into adulthood. And it works.
At the heart of Mission 2030 is you. You bring this curriculum to life in your classrooms every day. You promote your class so more students get financial education in your school. You stand up at school board meetings and state legislative hearings calling for this common sense change in the way we prepare the next generation for the real world.
NGPF is here to support you every step of the way. Whether you're here for comprehensive personal finance curriculum, engaging professional development opportunities, or a vibrant educator community you can lean on, you're in the right place!
There are lots of ways to get involved in Mission 2030. Here are a few steps you can take today:
